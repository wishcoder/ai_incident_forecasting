            <h2>Incident Description</h2>
            <p>Recent updates to Service-4 inadvertently introduced a critical bug that affected data exchange with the database, significantly impacting the functionality and performance of App-3 and App-4.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section impact-analysis">
            <h2>Impact Analysis</h2>
            <p>The bug in Service-4 disrupted normal data processing and exchange, leading to data inconsistencies and significant performance degradation for App-3 and App-4, affecting end-user experience and operational efficiency.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section root-cause-analysis">
            <h2>Root Cause</h2>
            <p>An analysis revealed that the configuration changes in Service-4 made during the recent update included incompatible API updates. These changes broke the existing integration with Service-3 and the database, leading to the observed issues.</p>

        <section class="incident-section resolution-steps">
            <h2>Resolution Steps</h2>
            <p>1. The software development team quickly identified the issue through routine system checks and immediate feedback from affected services.</p>
            <p>2. A targeted hotfix was developed to address the specific bug introduced by the Service-4 update. This hotfix was tested rigorously in a controlled environment to ensure it resolved the issue without introducing new problems.</p>
            <p>3. The hotfix was deployed to the production environment, successfully rectifying the bug in Service-4 and restoring full functionality to App-3 and App-4 by 17:30.</p>
            <p>4. Post-deployment, additional monitoring was implemented to ensure the stability of the service and to quickly identify any further issues arising from the changes.</p>
