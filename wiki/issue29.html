            <h2>Incident Description</h2>
            <p>Recent unplanned changes to App-4's security configuration settings inadvertently introduced access restrictions, resulting in a lockout of several key users and disrupting normal application operations.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section impact-analysis">
            <h2>Impact Analysis</h2>
            <p>The user lockout caused significant operational disruptions, affecting critical workflows and leading to project delays, as well as considerable user dissatisfaction due to the unexpected access issues.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section root-cause-analysis">
            <h2>Root Cause</h2>
            <p>An investigation into the incident revealed that the configuration update applied an incompatible version of a critical security dependency, which led to runtime errors and subsequent user access issues.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section resolution-steps">
            <h2>Resolution Steps</h2>
            <p>1. The IT Operations team, upon notification of the issue, acted swiftly to review the recent configuration changes and identify the cause of the lockout.</p>
            <p>2. The problematic configuration changes were reversed, and the application was reverted to its previous stable state, effectively restoring access for all affected users.</p>
            <p>3. Full access was confirmed to be restored for all users by 10:30, and a comprehensive review of the change management process was initiated to enhance the application's security posture and prevent recurrence of similar incidents.</p>
