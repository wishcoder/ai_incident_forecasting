            <h2>Incident Description</h2>
            <p>Following recent updates to App-2's configuration settings aimed at enhancing system performance, unintended access restrictions were imposed on several users, disrupting their interaction with the application.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section impact-analysis">
            <h2>Impact Analysis</h2>
            <p>The unintended access restrictions resulted in a temporary loss of critical functionality for affected users, significantly impacting their user experience and the operational efficiency of App-2.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section root-cause-analysis">
            <h2>Root Cause</h2>
            <p>An in-depth investigation revealed that the configuration update erroneously included an invalid external service endpoint. This misconfiguration led to the breaking of essential functionalities within App-2, directly affecting user access.</p>

        <section class="incident-section resolution-steps">
            <h2>Resolution Steps</h2>
            <p>1. The IT support team, upon identifying the issue, initiated a comprehensive review of the recent configuration changes to pinpoint the cause of the access restrictions.</p>
            <p>2. Corrective actions were swiftly implemented to rectify the invalid endpoint configuration, thereby restoring the intended access and functionality to all affected users.</p>
            <p>3. Full functionality was confirmed to have returned to all users by 17:45, following the successful application of the configuration adjustments.</p>
            <p>4. Additional measures, including enhanced configuration change validation processes, were introduced to prevent recurrence of similar issues.</p>
