        <section class="incident-section resolution-steps">
            <h2>Resolution Steps</h2>
            <p>1. The configuration error was quickly detected through automated monitoring systems, triggering an immediate alert.</p>
            <p>2. The Cybersecurity team, in collaboration with Network Operations, initiated an emergency protocol to assess and correct the configuration.</p>
            <p>3. Configuration changes were meticulously reviewed and then rolled back to the previous stable version at 11:45, following a thorough verification process to ensure no other issues were present.</p>
            <p>4. Full service was restored to App-1 and App-2 by 12:15, after conducting extensive testing to confirm the resolution of the issue.</p>
            <p>5. A post-incident review was scheduled to analyze the incident in depth and to develop strategies to prevent similar occurrences in the future.</p>
