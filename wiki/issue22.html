            <h2>Incident Description</h2>
            <p>This morning, App-1 became unexpectedly inaccessible to all users. Preliminary investigations indicated a database connectivity issue, which was later identified as a result of the App-1 server's disk space being completely filled, preventing the application from initiating successfully.</p>

        <section class="incident-section impact-analysis">
            <h2>Impact Analysis</h2>
            <p>The inaccessibility of App-1 disrupted critical user transactions and data processing activities, leading to significant operational delays and impacting business continuity.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section root-cause-analysis">
            <h2>Root Cause</h2>
            <p>Detailed diagnostics revealed that the server hosting App-1 had its disk space fully utilized, primarily due to unchecked log file growth, which in turn prevented the application from accessing the database effectively.</p>

        <section class="incident-section resolution-steps">
            <h2>Resolution Steps</h2>
            <p>1. IT support was immediately notified of the issue and initiated a comprehensive diagnostic to pinpoint the root cause.</p>
            <p>2. Actions were taken to clear the unnecessary files and optimize the disk space usage on the server, ensuring that App-1 had sufficient resources to operate.</p>
            <p>3. The database connection was successfully restored, and App-1's accessibility was fully reinstated by 10:30, with measures implemented to monitor disk space usage closely to prevent recurrence.</p>
            <p>4. A review of log management and server maintenance practices was conducted to enhance system resilience and operational efficiency.</p>
