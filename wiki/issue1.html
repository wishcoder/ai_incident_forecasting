            <h2>Incident Description</h2>
            <p>Database-1 became inaccessible due to an unknown issue, impacting data access for multiple services and applications.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section impact-analysis">
            <h2>Impact Analysis</h2>
            <p>Service-2 and Service-4 are unable to access data, affecting Service-1 and Service-3's ability to provide data to App-1, App-2, App-3, and App-4, leading to significant functionality loss across the ecosystem.</p>

        <section class="incident-section root-cause-analysis">
            <h2>Root Cause</h2>
            <p>Database-1 became unresponsive due to a deadlock situation caused by conflicting transactions.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section resolution-steps">
            <h2>Resolution Steps</h2>
            <p>1. Identified and terminated the conflicting transactions causing the deadlock.</p>
            <p>2. Restarted Database-1 to restore access.</p>
            <p>3. Implemented additional monitoring on Database-1 to detect and alert on deadlock situations more rapidly.</p>
            <p>4. Reviewed and optimized transaction handling and queries in Service-2 and Service-4 to prevent future deadlocks.</p>

        <section class="incident-section lessons-learned">
            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
            <p>Investigation revealed a deadlock situation caused by conflicting transactions as the root cause. Future preventive measures include enhancing monitoring for early deadlock detection, regular audits of transaction handling and query optimization, and establishing a rapid response protocol for database accessibility issues to minimize impact on dependent services and applications.</p>
