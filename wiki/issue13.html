        <section class="incident-section incident-description">
            <h2>Incident Description</h2>
            <p>An incorrect configuration within Firewall-2's settings led to all external traffic being directed exclusively to App-4, inadvertently excluding App-3 from receiving any network traffic, which resulted in a complete service outage for App-3.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section impact-analysis">
            <h2>Impact Analysis</h2>
            <p>The misconfiguration caused a significant disruption, rendering App-3 completely inaccessible to external users, while App-4 experienced an overload of traffic, potentially affecting its performance and user experience.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section root-cause-analysis">
            <h2>Root Cause</h2>
            <p>The root cause was traced back to an incorrectly configured rule set in Firewall-2, which was intended to manage traffic between App-3 and App-4 but instead isolated App-3 due to a misdirected traffic flow.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section resolution-steps">
            <h2>Resolution Steps</h2>
            <p>1. The anomaly in traffic flow was detected through our network monitoring systems, which triggered an immediate investigation.</p>
            <p>2. Network engineers promptly reviewed and identified the misconfiguration within Firewall-2's settings.</p>
            <p>3. Corrective actions were taken to adjust the firewall configuration, ensuring a balanced and correct distribution of traffic to both App-3 and App-4.</p>
            <p>4. Normal service operations for App-3 were restored by 10:30, and measures were taken to monitor the traffic flow to prevent similar incidents.</p>

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
            <p>This incident reinforced the critical importance of accurate configuration management for network security devices and the effectiveness of network monitoring systems in identifying and mitigating issues promptly. It also highlighted the need for regular reviews of firewall rules and configurations to ensure they reflect the current network architecture and traffic management requirements accurately.</p>
