            <h2>Incident Description</h2>
            <p>An overnight update intended to enhance App-2's backend services inadvertently introduced a critical failure, resulting in the application becoming completely inaccessible to all users. This issue has significantly disrupted essential services and functionalities provided by App-2.</p>

        <section class="incident-section impact-analysis">
            <h2>Impact Analysis</h2>
            <p>The inaccessibility of App-2 has led to a halt in all user transactions and data processing activities, critically affecting both internal operations and the delivery of customer-facing services, thereby impacting overall business continuity and customer satisfaction.</p>

        <section class="incident-section root-cause-analysis">
            <h2>Root Cause</h2>
            <p>Detailed analysis identified that the failure was due to a corrupt database index caused by the latest update, which was not detected during the initial deployment process.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section resolution-steps">
            <h2>Resolution Steps</h2>
            <p>1. Upon detection of the issue, the IT support team immediately alerted the development team, who began an urgent investigation into the cause of the failure.</p>
            <p>2. The development team identified the corrupt database index as the root cause and decided to perform a rollback to the application's state before the update to quickly restore service functionality.</p>
            <p>3. App-2's services were fully restored, and operational status was achieved by 09:30, following the successful rollback and verification of system integrity and performance.</p>
            <p>4. Post-incident, a review of the update and deployment procedures was conducted to strengthen the testing and validation processes, particularly focusing on database integrity and application stability.</p>
