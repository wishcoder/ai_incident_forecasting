        <section class="incident-section incident-description">
            <h2>Incident Description</h2>
            <p>An incorrect routing rule in Firewall-2 directed all incoming traffic exclusively to App-3, inadvertently leaving App-4 inaccessible and disrupting its service.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section impact-analysis">
            <h2>Impact Analysis</h2>
            <p>App-4's inaccessibility from external networks severely impacted its operational capabilities, user access, and service delivery, while App-3 experienced an unexpected surge in traffic.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section root-cause-analysis">
            <h2>Root Cause</h2>
            <p>A configuration error in Firewall-2's routing rules mistakenly directed all incoming traffic to App-3, completely neglecting the designated routes for App-4.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section resolution-steps">
            <h2>Resolution Steps</h2>
            <p>1. The misconfiguration was quickly identified through detailed traffic monitoring and analysis.</p>
            <p>2. Immediate corrective action was taken to revise and properly implement the routing rules, ensuring balanced traffic distribution to both App-3 and App-4.</p>
            <p>3. Access to App-4 was fully restored by 12:30, and operational stability was confirmed through subsequent monitoring.</p>
            <p>4. A comprehensive review of firewall configuration processes was initiated to enhance oversight and prevent similar incidents.</p>
