        <section class="incident-section incident-description">
            <h2>Incident Description</h2>
            <p>A misconfiguration in Firewall-1's routing rules directed all incoming external traffic exclusively to App-1, leaving App-2 inaccessible and causing an unintended overload on App-1.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section impact-analysis">
            <h2>Impact Analysis</h2>
            <p>App-2 was completely cut off from external access, disrupting services for users dependent on it, while App-1 experienced an unexpected surge in traffic, potentially affecting its performance and availability.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section root-cause-analysis">
            <h2>Root Cause</h2>
            <p>The root cause was identified as a typo in Firewall-1's configuration, which mistakenly routed all traffic to App-1 instead of distributing it appropriately between App-1 and App-2.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section resolution-steps">
            <h2>Resolution Steps</h2>
            <p>1. The routing misconfiguration was quickly identified by the network team through routine system checks and alerts from the monitoring system.</p>
            <p>2. Immediate corrective action was taken to adjust the routing rules, ensuring a balanced distribution of traffic to both App-1 and App-2.</p>
            <p>3. The corrected configuration was applied, and normal traffic flow was restored by 09:15, with continuous monitoring to ensure stability.</p>
            <p>4. A comprehensive review of firewall configurations was initiated to prevent similar incidents.</p>

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
            <p>This incident underscored the critical importance of validating configuration changes through a staging environment before deployment to production. It also highlighted the need for immediate post-deployment checks to ensure all services are operating as expected. Additionally, the incident reinforced the value of having a robust monitoring system in place that can quickly detect and alert on such misconfigurations, minimizing the impact on service availability and performance.</p>
