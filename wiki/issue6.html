        <section class="incident-section incident-description">
            <h2>Incident Description</h2>
            <p>Firewall-1 became unresponsive, disrupting network traffic flow and access control for App-1 and App-2. Initial assessments suggested a power supply failure, but further investigation revealed a software issue.</p>

        <section class="incident-section impact-analysis">
            <h2>Impact Analysis</h2>
            <p>The downtime of Firewall-1 led to a temporary loss of external connectivity for App-1 and App-2, significantly impacting user access and compromising data security protocols.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section root-cause-analysis">
            <h2>Root Cause</h2>
            <p>Further diagnostics identified the root cause as a software crash due to a memory leak within Firewall-1's operating system.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section resolution-steps">
            <h2>Resolution Steps</h2>
            <p>1. Immediate escalation to the network operations team for detailed diagnostics.</p>
            <p>2. Temporary measures were implemented to reroute critical traffic through an alternative path while the issue was being resolved.</p>
            <p>3. The software issue was addressed by applying an emergency patch to fix the memory leak, and the system was closely monitored for stability.</p>
            <p>4. Firewall-1 was successfully rebooted, and full functionality was restored by 16:00, after which traffic was rerouted back to its original path.</p>
