            <h2>Incident Description</h2>
            <p>Service-4 became inaccessible due to a network configuration issue early this morning, disrupting essential data services for App-3 and App-4. Initial assessments indicate a failure triggered by exhausted system resources.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section impact-analysis">
            <h2>Impact Analysis</h2>
            <p>The outage of Service-4 halted critical data processing and retrieval operations, significantly impacting the functionality and user experience of App-3 and App-4.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section root-cause-analysis">
            <h2>Root Cause</h2>
            <p>An exhaustive analysis revealed that Service-4's inaccessibility was due to system resource exhaustion, compounded by a misconfigured network setting that failed to allocate additional resources as needed.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section resolution-steps">
            <h2>Resolution Steps</h2>
            <p>1. Immediate action was taken by IT Support to diagnose the network configuration issue, identifying the exhausted system resources as the primary cause.</p>
            <p>2. Network configurations were promptly adjusted to correct the resource allocation issue, and Service-4's system resources were expanded to handle the increased load.</p>
            <p>3. Service-4 was successfully restarted and closely monitored to ensure stability and full operational functionality, with service fully restored by 12:00.</p>
            <p>4. Post-incident, a comprehensive review of network and resource management configurations was conducted to prevent recurrence.</p>
