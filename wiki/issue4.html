            <h2>Incident Description</h2>
            <p>Router-2 became unreachable due to a suspected hardware failure, disrupting external connectivity for App-3 and App-4.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section impact-analysis">
            <h2>Impact Analysis</h2>
            <p>The loss of Router-2 connectivity halted all external traffic to App-3 and App-4, significantly impacting user operations and service delivery.</p>

        <section class="incident-section resolution-steps">
            <h2>Resolution Steps</h2>
            <p>1. Immediate notification to the hardware team for diagnostics.</p>
            <p>2. Temporary routing adjustments made to divert traffic through Router-1 while Router-2 was under investigation.</p>
            <p>3. Hardware fault identified and Router-2 was replaced at 14:30.</p>
            <p>4. After replacement, Router-2 was brought back online and normal service for App-3 and App-4 was restored by 15:00.</p>
