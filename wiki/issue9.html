            <h2>Incident Description</h2>
            <p>Due to an error in Firewall-1's configuration, all incoming external traffic was incorrectly directed to App-2, bypassing App-1 entirely.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section impact-analysis">
            <h2>Impact Analysis</h2>
            <p>This misdirection resulted in App-1 being inaccessible to its users, while App-2 faced unexpected traffic spikes.</p>

        <section class="incident-section resolution-steps">
            <h2>Resolution Steps</h2>
            <p>1. The configuration anomaly was quickly spotted by the IT security team.</p>
            <p>2. Corrective measures were implemented to redistribute traffic appropriately between App-1 and App-2 by 12:30.</p>
