            <h2>Incident Description</h2>
            <p>Service-3 became unexpectedly inaccessible due to a network partition this morning, disrupting critical data services for App-3 and App-4. This isolation from its consumers prevented any data interactions between the service and the applications, significantly impacting their operational capabilities and user experience.</p>

        <section class="incident-section impact-analysis">
            <h2>Impact Analysis</h2>
            <p>The sudden outage of Service-3 caused a halt in all data processing and retrieval operations for App-3 and App-4, leading to service degradation and affecting end-users' ability to access and utilize the applications effectively.</p>

        <section class="incident-section root-cause-analysis">
            <h2>Root Cause</h2>
            <p>An in-depth investigation revealed that the inaccessibility of Service-3 was due to a misconfigured network router, which created a network partition, isolating Service-3 from its intended network segment.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section resolution-steps">
            <h2>Resolution Steps</h2>
            <p>1. The service disruption was quickly detected through our network monitoring systems, prompting an immediate investigation by network administrators.</p>
            <p>2. The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in one of the network routers. Corrective actions were taken to reconfigure the router settings properly, eliminating the network partition and restoring full connectivity to Service-3.</p>
            <p>3. Service-3 was closely monitored following the correction to ensure stability and full operational functionality, with service fully restored by 13:30.</p>
            <p>4. Additional measures, including a review and update of network configuration management practices, were implemented to prevent similar incidents.</p>
