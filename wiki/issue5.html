            <h2>Incident Description</h2>
            <p>During a scheduled update, configuration changes were applied to Router-2, inadvertently blocking external access to App-3 and App-4 due to an incorrect subnet mask setting.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section impact-analysis">
            <h2>Impact Analysis</h2>
            <p>The misconfiguration resulted in a complete loss of service for external users of App-3 and App-4, affecting critical business operations and disrupting service delivery.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section root-cause-analysis">
            <h2>Root Cause</h2>
            <p>An incorrect subnet mask was applied during Router-2's configuration update, leading to routing issues that prevented external access to App-3 and App-4.</p>

        <section class="incident-section resolution-steps">
            <h2>Resolution Steps</h2>
            <p>1. The issue was detected through automated monitoring alerts and immediate manual checks by the IT Support team.</p>
            <p>2. IT Support initiated an emergency protocol to assess and rectify the configuration errors.</p>
            <p>3. Configuration changes were rolled back to the last known good configuration at 10:15, following a quick review to confirm the rollback would not introduce other issues.</p>
            <p>4. Full service was restored to App-3 and App-4 by 10:45, after thorough testing to ensure connectivity was fully functional.</p>
            <p>5. A post-incident review was scheduled to discuss the incident and implement measures to prevent future occurrences.</p>

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
            <p>This incident emphasized the critical need for a more rigorous pre-deployment testing phase for any configuration changes to critical network infrastructure, ensuring that all changes are vetted through a comprehensive review process. It also highlighted the importance of having a quick and effective rollback strategy for immediately addressing any issues that arise post-deployment, minimizing downtime and service disruption. The incident further underlined the value of automated monitoring systems in quickly detecting and alerting on operational anomalies.</p>
