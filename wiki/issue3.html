        <section class="incident-section incident-description">
            <h2>Incident Description</h2>
            <p>Unscheduled configuration changes to Router-1 led to a loss of external connectivity for App-1 and App-2. The changes were made inadvertently during routine maintenance.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section impact-analysis">
            <h2>Impact Analysis</h2>
            <p>The configuration changes disrupted normal operations, preventing external access to App-1 and App-2. This incident affected user transactions and data processing capabilities, highlighting the critical nature of Router-1 in the network infrastructure.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section root-cause-analysis">
            <h2>Root Cause</h2>
            <p>Incorrect Router-1 configuration update applied, which included invalid routing rules and inadvertently disrupted the traffic flow to Firewall-1, thereby affecting App-1 and App-2.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="incident-section resolution-steps">
            <h2>Resolution Steps</h2>
            <p>1. The issue was identified as a misconfiguration during a routine review.</p>
            <p>2. Configuration changes were rolled back to the previous stable state at 15:00.</p>
            <p>3. Full connectivity for App-1 and App-2 was restored by 15:30, after confirming the correct traffic flow through Firewall-1.</p>
            <p>4. Conducted a post-mortem analysis to understand the missteps and implement safeguards.</p>

        <section class="incident-section lessons-learned">
            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
            <p>The incident highlighted the need for stricter change management protocols, including pre-approval processes for any configuration changes to critical network components. It underscored the importance of immediate rollback capabilities, comprehensive logging of all changes, and enhanced training for IT staff on the potential impacts of configuration changes. Additionally, the incident emphasized the need for a robust validation process post-configuration change to ensure network stability and service availability.</p>
